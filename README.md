# Longdon Decorative - Fixed



This repo contains the font Longdon Decorative by Roger White, which was originally released under an open source licence.

The version of this font which is mainly available on the internet has some kind of corrupt glyph table. Please don't ask me what a corrupt glyph table is, all I know is, it prevents the font from working in browsers as a web font, and also throws up errors in many font conversion tools.

I've run that corrupt version through [transfonter](https://transfonter.org/) and here I present the results. Check out `stylesheet.css` if you want to use this in a web project, or download the individual fonts for desktop use.
